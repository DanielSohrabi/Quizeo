# Quizeo

Welcome to Quizeo, a quizzing app made with React.js.

This is a personal react experiment, where my goals are to practice using the following:
- Asynchronous code and fetch api
- Local storage (not implemented yet)
- Logic handling for a simple quiz
- Basic styling

## Known Bugs

- Rate limiting causes quiz to show nothing after pressing start quiz
- Text wrapping for longer answer breaks answer buttons
- Styling is not suited for different screen sizes as of now
- Instances of list children missing the key prop
