# Quizeo

Welcome to Quizeo, a quizzing app made with React.js.

This is a personal react experiment, where my goals are to practice using the following:
- Asynchronous Code and Fetch API
- Local Storage (Not implemented yet)
- State management
- Reusable React Components

## Known Bugs

- Rate limiting causes quiz to show nothing after pressing play button.
- Text wrapping for longer answers breaks answer buttons.
- Styling is not suited for different screen sizes.
- Instances of list children missing the key prop.
